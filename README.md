# Lilith

[Terralith](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Terralith) fork with [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) compatibility.

# How?

Folia and derivatives do not properly support datapack functions. This simply removes the functions from Terralith.

# Where are the releases?

As per the Terralith license (which is maintained in this repository in its original form), I am not allowed to distribute this modified version of the Terralith code.

However, from what I can tell, there is no restriction imposed upon me simply maintaining this fork *without* releases. If you are from Stardust Labs, and would like me to take this repository down, please make an issue and inform me. I do not intend to infringe upon your license in this project.
